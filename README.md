# U.S-States-Game
This is an interactive Python Turtle game where you guess the names of U.S. states. A map of the U.S. is displayed, and you type state names to place them correctly on the map.

I built this project as part of my learning journey in Python with guidance from my course instructor and ChatGPT (not fully my own idea).

🚀 Features

🐢 Uses Turtle Graphics to display a U.S. map.

⏱️ Timer-based gameplay – choose your difficulty:

Easy → 10 minutes

Medium → 5 minutes

Hard → 3 minutes

🎯 Keeps track of guessed states in real time.

🖊️ Correct guesses are written on the map at the right location.

❌ Type Exit anytime to stop the game early.

📂 Files in this Project

main.py → The game code.

50_states.csv → CSV file containing U.S. states and their coordinates.

blank_states_img.gif → Image file of the blank U.S. map used in the game.

(You can add a screenshot/gif of your game here later for better presentation.)

📌 Future Improvements

🔗 Add CSV + map support for other countries (e.g., India, Canada, Europe).

🕹️ Live updating timer display on screen (like a digital clock).

💾 Save user progress and high scores.

🌍 Choose different regions/maps at the start of the game.

Code and idea were implemented with the guidance of my course instructor and with support from ChatGPT.

Not done fully by myself alone — I followed instructions and learned while building this project.
